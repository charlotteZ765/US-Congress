If you didn't know vectorization or didn't think it would be useful to create those precomputed columns, you could still get considerable speedup by letting the naive function have access to the mapping dictionaries that we created earlier; that is, `us_char_count`, `us_syllables_count`, `uk_char_count`, and `uk_syllables_count`. The key insight is that the number of characters or syllables in a word should be calculated just once and subsequently looked up as needed.\n",
